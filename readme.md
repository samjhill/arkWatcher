# arkWatcher
arkWatcher is a RESTful API that provides useful information about your [ARK:Survival Evolved](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/) Server.


## Install & Run

First, install and set up [ark-server-tools](https://github.com/FezVrasta/ark-server-tools). Check to make sure you're ready to go by running `arkmanager status`. 

Once that's all set, it's pretty simple.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/samjhill/arkWatcher.git
node index.js
```

You should see the following:
```shell
listening on port 4730
```
Now, just navigate to http://localhost:4730/status to see if it's working!


## API

### /status

Returns the status of the server.

Sample response:
```json
[
["serverRunning","Yes"],
["serverOnline","Yes"],
["serverName","Puesto - (v217.2)"],
["players","0 / 15"],
["serverVersion","799915"]
]
```


## Future Work
Add more information in the status command
Add admin authentication
Add POST requests to run commands remotely
